Additionally, we feed and rescue stray dogs, going beyond mere sustenance. Our mission also includes tree planting for a greener and healthier environment.

We are officially registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, dedicated to charitable and not-for-profit purposes. Thaagam Foundation has received 12AA and 80G certificates from the Income Tax Department, affirming our transparency.
